<div class="tips">
  <h2>Travel tips</h2>
  <p>When traveling alone, renting places are not that ideal as it is expensive. <br><br>An alternative way is to go full backpacking-style to Japan and stay at capsule hotels. Also, vending machines are a quick and easy way to get food or drinks on the go. <br><br>In addition to all that, Japan is relatively safe and mindful of others' belongings. <br><br>If you forget your items in a train from a previous station, you can inform people in the information center in front of stations or the guards up front.</p>
