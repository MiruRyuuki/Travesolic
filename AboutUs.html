  <p>Travesolic is a website where a group of students of diploma in Information Technology will share each of
their unique experiences and adventures when they travel to their dreamed destination. <br><br>This group of students
are Michelle Ling, Michelle Vania, Maike Alessandra, Daniel Tandiono and Xian Sheng. We have been
classmates since August 2019. <br><br>This idea was started by Michelle Vania while we were talking about her
hometown, Bali, Indonesia when we first met in class. Around December 2019, we started this travelling
alone plan at the same date and decided to share our thoughts with all by creating this website named
“TRAVESOLIC”
<br><br>Each of us came from different backgrounds, states/countries, people might be expecting us to travel together,
however we think this idea is too mainstream and decided to do something extraordinary, where people least
expect us to do it, which is travelling alone.
<br><br>The reason each and everyone of us agreed with the website name “TRAVESOLIC '' is that it is a combination
of travel + holic ( example: “alcoholic” = addicted to alcohol but ours is addicted to travel + solo ( travelling
alone). We removed the ‘ L’ from the word travel because we want to express our intention that it is okay to
travel alone without having your ‘L’oved ones such as friends and family to keep you accompany. You can
find yourself back or get to know yourself better when travelling alone. <br><br>As Freya Stark once noted, <br>“To
awaken quite alone in a strange town is one of the pleasantest sensations in the world.”
<br><br>Besides, We also share some general travel tips and high-quality images which we have obtained while
travelling and everyone is welcomed to contact us if you have any queries or doubt travelling alone. </p>
