    <h2>The Great Wall</h2>
    <p>The Great Wall was not just a wall. It was an integrated military defensive system with watchtowers for surveillance, fortresses for command posts and logistics, beacon towers for communications, etc.</p>
    <p>In the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644), the Great Wall was reconstructed to be stronger and more sophisticated, due to better construction techniques being developed.</p>
    <p>The wall body: The Ming Great Wall usually had battlements 1.8 meters (6 feet) high with loopholes and crenels, and parapet walls 1.2 meters (4 feet) high.</p>
    <p>Flanking towers: Every 500 meters or less (1,640 feet) on the Great Wall there was a flanking tower allowing defenders to shoot arrows at attackers at the face of the wall.</p>
    <p>Fortresses were built at important/vulnerable access points (passes), such as Shanhai Pass Fortress, Juyong Pass Fortress, and Jiayu Pass Fortress. There were many archery windows and gates on the forts. The fortress gatehouses were the strongest and most impregnable structures on the Great Wall.</p>

    <h2>Xi'an</h2>
    <p>Xi'an, the capital city of 13 different Chinese dynasties, has a long and storied history. Many dynasties from about 3,000 to 1,000 years ago had their capital city here, which is how it came to be called the fountainhead of civilization for China.</p> 
    <p>The city influenced the west via the Silk Road as it was the end of the historical route in China. The Ming Dynasty revitalized the city in the 14th century, with a new built around the perimeter. This period also saw the city renamed Xi’an, or “Western Peace.”</p>

<div class="tips">
  <h2>Travel tips</h2>
  <p>Ask for Xiao Pan- If eating alone, ask for “xiao pan”. These are small portions and work out at 70% of the size and price of a normal dish.</p>
  <p>Stick to public transportation– You can get pretty much anywhere in all the major cities by bus or subway — and it’s super affordable. Do as the locals do if you want to save money.</p>
  <p>Hard Seats– Travel on the “hard seats” on trains or buses. These are the cheapest and most basic seats but are not “hard” as the name would lead you to believe (they’re just regular seats).</p>
