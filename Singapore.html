<h1>Singapore</h1>
<div class="intro">
  <p> Singapore is an island country off the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula in Southeast Asia. It is separated from Malaysia by the Straits of Johor, and from Indonesia's Riau Islands by the Singapore Strait. Singapore has a strategic location for Southeast Asian sea routes.It’s a large business and shopping centre. But don’t get too excited, there’s not much sympathy for consumers who are cautious with their money. But you can have a go at haggling even in the most modern of shopping centres. There are massive sales in June and July.Public transport is perfectly organised, though you should still think twice before taking out that sandwich on a metro. Before entering the city centre, you can get into one of the numerous cars that are waiting for travellers, as they can’t drive off without them, but you should still tour the city on foot and experience the world of views.</p>

    <h2> Garden by the Bay</h2>
    <p> One of the greatest attractions includes Gardens by the Bay that consist of three parts – southern, eastern and central – and are home to more than half a million plants. <br><br>The Flower Dome, the world’s largest greenhouse, is located in the southern part. The Cloud Forest area recreates conditions typical for altitudes between 1000 and 2000 metres in the tropical zone. There are also various tree-lined boulevards and tree structures resembling super trees in the complex.</p>

    <h2>River Safari Singapore</h2>
    <p> Singapore’s noticeable icon is the Merlion statue, which is also the country’s mascot. It has a lion’s head, Singapore meaning The Lion City, and the body of a fish, representing the city’s fishing past. <br><br>There are five official Merlion statues in the city, all of various sizes with the tallest reaching a height of 37 metres. Singapore is wild. The River Safari theme park just begs you to explore it. There, you’ll encounter pandas, large fish, small crocodiles and many more.</p>

    <h2>The Sentosa Island</h2>
    <p>The Sentosa Island offers a spectacular night show against the open sea titled Wings of Time. Watch the 3D projection, laser show and fireworks display as they conjure up the story of Shahbaz, an ancient bird travelling through time and space. <br><br>The island is known for being a place of entertainment and relaxation and it’s a nice way to end any travel holiday. There are countless beaches and themed parks to explore. You can fly to Sentosa Island with a cable car from Mount Faber on the mainland.</p>

  <h2>Travel tips</h2>
  <p>What else can you do in Singapore? Well, don’t carry around any durians, that’s for sure. <br><br>It’s a quite smelly fruit and you can’t go everywhere with it. Plus, it can easily be smelled, you can be sure of that. And, of course, don’t ever criticise the president</p>
