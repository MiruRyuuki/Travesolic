    <h2> The Grand Palace</h2>
    <p> The Grand Palace (Thai: พระบรมมหาราชวัง, RTGS: Phra Borom Maha Ratcha Wang) is a complex of buildings at the heart of Bangkok, Thailand. The palace has been the official residence of the Kings of Siam (and later Thailand) since 1782. <br><br>The king, his court, and his royal government were based on the grounds of the palace until 1925. King Bhumibol Adulyadej (Rama IX), resided at the Chitralada Royal Villa and his successor King Vajiralongkorn (Rama X) at the Amphorn Sathan Residential Hall, both in the Dusit Palace, but the Grand Palace is still used for official events. Several royal ceremonies and state functions are held within the walls of the palace every year. The palace is one of the most popular tourist attractions in Thailand.</p>

    <h2>Chao Phraya River</h2>
    <p>Travelling up and down the Chao Phraya river is definitely one of the best ways to see Bangkok. Although there are special tourist boats available, it is also easy to just hop on the regular commuter ferries that travel up and down the river.

<br><br>You can either sit down and let the boat take you all the way up and down while you enjoy the sights, or you can disembark when you see something interesting, and then continue your trip later (you have to pay the fee, 15 Baht, every time you enter the ferry).

A super easy and cheap way to see Bangkok from the water.</p>

<div class="tips">
  <h2>Travel tips</h2>
  <p>In Thailand, the head is considered the most important part of the body. Don’t touch a Thai person on the head; it’s considered very rude and offensive.

<br>Another thing to avoid is pointing with your feet towards a person or an image of Buddha or the King.

<br><br>Keeping face is also an important part of Thai culture. Raising your voice and getting angry with the locals will get you nowhere.

<br><br>It’s also against the law to speak negatively about the royal family. If you’re caught criticizing the monarchy, you can face serious jail time.</p>
