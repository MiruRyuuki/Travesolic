    <h1>General Travel Tips</h1>
    <p><i>Travesolic Team would like to share some general travel tips we obtained while travelling so that you trip to theses countries will go on smoothly!</i></p><br>

</div>
<div class="tip1">
  <h2>Tips 1: <u>Always pack a towel.</u></h2>
  <img src = "img/tips1.jpg" class="tipss" alt="towelimage" width = "400" height = "200">
  <p>It’s the key to successful galactic hitchhiking and plain common sense. You never know when you will need it, whether it’s at the beach, on a picnic, or just to dry off. While many hostels offer towels, you never know and carrying a small towel won’t add that much weight to your bag.</p><br>
</div>
<div class="tip2">
  <h2>Tips 2: <u>Buy a small backpack/suitcase.</u></h2>
  <img src = "img/tips2.jpg" class="tipss" alt="smallbackpackimage" width = "400" height = "200">
  <p>By purchasing a small backpack (I like something around 35/40 liters), you will be forced you to pack light and avoid carrying too much stuff. Humans have a natural tendency to want to fill space so if you pack light but have lots of extra room in your bag, you’ll end up going “well, I guess I can take more” and then regret it.</p><br>
</div>
<div class="tip3">
  <h2>Tips 3: <u>Pack light.</u></h2>
  <img src = "img/tips3.jpg" class="tipss" alt="lightimage" width = "400" height = "200">
  <p>It’s OK to wear the same t-shirt a few days in a row. Take half the clothes you think you will need…you won’t need as much as you think. Write down a list of essentials, cut it in half, and then only pack that! Plus, since you bought a small backpack like I said, you won’t have much room for extra stuff anyways!</p><br>
</div>
<div class="tip4">
  <h2>Tips 4: <u>Make sure to use no-fee bank cards.</u></h2>
  <img src = "img/tips4.jpg" class="tipss" alt="bankcardimage" width = "400" height = "200">
  <p>Don’t give banks your hard-earned money. Keep that for yourself and spend it on your travels. Get a credit card and debit card that doesn’t charge a foreign transaction fee or an ATM fee. Over the course of a long trip, the few dollars they take every time will really add up!</p><br>
</div>
<div class="tip5">
  <h2>Tips 5: <u>Make extra copies of your passport and important documents.</u></h2>
  <img src = "img/tips5.jpg" class="tipss" alt="importantdocumentsimage" width = "400" height = "200">
  <p>Don’t forget to e-mail a copy to yourself too. You never know when you might need to have some sort of documentation with you and might not want to carry your original. Additionally, if your passport gets stolen having a copy will come in handy for your police report.</p><br>
